The sewer system is a complicated and heavily monitored necessity for toilets to actually work. 
Treatment plants filter water incredibly well, using new and old technology. Most germs, trash, 
waste, you name it, will be removed from the water. It is necessary for all those gross things 
to be removed because the water is dumped into larger, natural water sources, including ones 
that lead into the oceans. Unfortunately, one of the things that just can’t be removed from 
treated water is medications. As you may know, medication overdoses and medication taken by the 
wrong person is extremely hazardous and can lead to big problems even larger than what the medicine
was supposed to fix, even death in the consumer. These factors added together means that if flushed, 
possibly lethal doses of medicine are in large sources of water near you. Even if you stay away 
from that water, the medicine will be ingested by the marine life there, staying dangerous 
throughout the food chain. The same problem occurs when you throw your medications in the trash. 
The medicine will end up in landfills, ultimately penetrating the ground and ultimately, 
the groundwater. In this situation, the medicine could be absorbed by plants, too. Please,
use the link above and find where you can dispose meds.
