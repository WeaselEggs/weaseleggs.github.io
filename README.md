# Safely Dispose of your Medications

Donâ€™t flush or throw away your medications because it hurts the environment and you in a bad way. If you flush medications, they dissolve into the water and cannot be filtered out in water treatment centers. Also if you throw your medications away the medications will dissolve into the ground water and become part of the water cycle. In conclusion, to safely dispose of your meds, bring them to a medicine dropbox at your local pharmacy or police station. To find the nearest dropbox in your area look at the list below.
